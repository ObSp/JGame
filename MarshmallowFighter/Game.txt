GAME IDEA:

Game about trying to find the cause of the transformation of marshmallows into evil creatures


GAME TIMELINE:

You start inside the house. There is a book on the floor that you can pick up, but all the pages are missing.
Eventually, you exit the house and are teleported to a sectioned-off area, where a group of marshmallows surround...
something. You are given the ability to swing a sword and proceed to dispose of the marshmallows, discovering that
they drop loot that you can pick up. Once all the marshmallows are gone, you open the thing in the middle to find a
piece of paper. A page of your book! Inside, you find a journal entry of what appears to be someone investigating 
the transformation of marshmallows. Great! Now you just need to find the rest of the pages and the mystery will be solved!
Thus begins a journey of reclaiming page sites from the evils that have overtaken them, and transforming the marshmallows
into the cute things they used to be.
